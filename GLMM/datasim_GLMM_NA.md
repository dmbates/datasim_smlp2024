# Description

This is a simulated data set with accompanying data analysis which was
used as basis for a power simulation for an experiment at the
Leibniz-Institut für Wissensmedien (IWM).

Underlying idea of the study: People construct mental representations of
a scene while reading, meaning textual content is, e.g., translated into
visual mental representations. This is tested by switching the
presentation modality between the learning and the test phase. During
the learning phase, subjects are presented with a scene description in
text form. In the test phase, the scenes are presented either in text or
in graphical form.

Transfer of text-based modality to visual modality:

- Are participants able to identify information in a visual
  representation of a scene they read?

- How accurate is it?

Participants read 25 sentences that can be either true (15) or false
(10). Afterwards, they have to judge if a scene is true or false. This
scene is either presented as text or as a picture.

The dependent variable is correct answer: true sentence is classified as
true.

The manipulated conditions are:

- representation: text vs. picture

- veracity of sentence: true vs. false (indicated by color of the
  sentence)

# Hypothesis

Participants will be better in identifying *false* information in a
text-based representation than participants who must identify false
information in a graphical representation of the scene. No difference
for true information is expected.

``` r
# Hypothesis: 0.1 probability difference for true vs. false for graphic representation
design <- data.frame(representation = factor(rep(c("text", "graphic"), each = 2),
                                             levels = c("text", "graphic")),
                     veracity = factor(rep(c("true", "false"), 2),
                                       levels = c("true", "false")),
                     prob = c(0.55, 0.55, 0.50, 0.40))

xyplot(prob ~ representation, data = design, groups = veracity,
       type = "b", ylim = 0:1, auto.key = list(space = "top"))
